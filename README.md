# Website - Ivor Parke Painters & Decorators

As part of the web design module COMP20030 in my first year, I was set with the task of creating a fully functional website for the assignment. We were told to create a site for a business (real or made-up). I went with my dads company, "Ivor Parke Painters & Decorators", as he did not have a website and I felt it would be beneficial for his business. This assignment was very enjoyable as it gave me a great opportunity to apply my skills whilst also assisting my dads business as I was giving him a functional and presentable website. It was a very rewarding experience, mixed with academic learning with real world impact.


I started with creating a wireframe so I could plan the layout of the website and ensure an enjoyable user experience. I also focused on the colour scheme, using trial and error to pick the perfect tones to complement the overall aesthetic of the website. The project involved working with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I added an SQL database that allowed users to leave their contact info so Ivor Parke could get in contact with the potential client. This assignment enhanced my skills as I worked on both coding and also the design elements of the website - improving my technical abilities and also my creative design.
