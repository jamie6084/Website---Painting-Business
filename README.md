# Website - Ivor Parke Painters & Decorators
As part of the web design module (COMP20030) during my first year, I was tasked with creating a website for one of the assignments. We were instructed to design a site for a business—real or fictional. I chose my dad's company, Ivor Parke Painters & Decorators, as he was in need of an online presence. This assignment provided a perfect opportunity to apply my skills while also helping my dad’s business by giving him a functional and professional website. It was a rewarding experience, combining academic learning with real-world impact.

The creation of the website started with designing a wireframe to plan the layout and ensure an intuitive user experience. I focused on refining the color scheme, using trial and error to select the right tones to complement the overall look and feel of the site. The project involved working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and I also integrated an SQL database that allowed visitors to leave their contact details so Ivor Parke could reach out to potential clients. This assignment greatly enhanced my skills, as I worked extensively on both the coding and the overall design elements of the website, improving my technical abilities and creative thinking.
